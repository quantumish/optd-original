/// This trait defines helper functions to enable cardinality testing on a dbms

///   get the true and estimated cardinalities for _each_ dbms. However, we
///   can now choose to only get the true cardinalities of _one_ dbms to
///   improve performance or even cache the true cardinalities. Additionally, if
///   we do want to get the true cardinalities of all dbmss, we can compare
///   them against each other to ensure they're all equal. All these options are
///   possible when exposing "get true card" and "get est card" instead of a
///   single "get qerror". If you want to compute the Q-error of a single
///   dbms, just create a CardtestRunner with a single dbms as input.
/// When exposing a "get true card" and "get est card" interface, you could
///   ostensibly do it on the granularity of a single SQL string or on the
///   granularity of an entire benchmark. I chose the latter for a simple reason:
///   different dbmss might have different SQL strings for the same conceptual
///   query (see how qgen in tpch-kit takes in dbms as an input).
/// When more performance tests are implemented, you would probably want to extract
///   get_name() into a generic "DBMS" trait.
